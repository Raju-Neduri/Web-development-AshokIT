      The HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until
      styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox
      is applied to its parent element).

    <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
    <p>
      Java is an object-oriented, class-based programming language. The language is designed to have as few
      dependencies implementations as possible. The intention of using this language is to give relief to the
      developers from writing codes for every platform. The term WORA, write once and run everywhere is often
      associated with this language. It means whenever we compile a Java code, we get the byte code (.class file), and
      that can be executed (without compiling it again) on different platforms provided they support Java. In the year
      1995, Java language was developed. It is mainly used to develop web, desktop, and mobile devices. The Java
      language is known for its robustness, security, and simplicity features. That is designed to have as few
      implementation dependencies as possible.

    <h1>Java OOPs Concepts</h1>
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides
        many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.</li>

      <li>Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything
        is
        represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.</li>

      <li> Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.</li>

      <li>The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.</li>

      <li>The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object, classes,
        abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.</li>
