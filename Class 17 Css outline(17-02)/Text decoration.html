    Yemen’s port of Aden indicating an explosion close to it.

    The Sea Champion, with 23 crew members, was sailing from Argentina to Aden carrying grain when it was attacked,
    Greek shipping ministry sources told Reuters. There were two attempted attacks with missiles which exploded 10-15
    metres from the ship, damaging a window, the sources added. </p>
